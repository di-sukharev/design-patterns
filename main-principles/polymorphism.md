# Polymorphism

Polymorphism principle describes how different objects implementing same behaviour can be used as it would be the same object.

For example: if something swims like a duck and cuacks like a duck, then it must be a duck.
So, any object that implement swim() and cuack() methods can be treated as a duck.
